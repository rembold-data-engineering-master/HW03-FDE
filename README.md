# Homework 3

The data that you are working with in this assignment could not easily fit within a GitHub repository, so you will need to download it directly from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv).

Then your primary responsibilities are inserting the data into an SQL table and then running a variety of queries doing different sorts of calculations to answer the questions on the pdf.
