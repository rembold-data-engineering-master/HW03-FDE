# Problem 3
- Who did you work with?:
- Estimated time spent on problem?:

This problem almost assuredly will take you multiple steps. Include your used SQL queries within the markdown triple backtick syntax, and _provide some text explanation_ of what you were doing in between! **Don't forget to upload your output CSV as well as this file.**


## Example (you can remove once you understand)

Here we can start with some explanation, followed by some code/query:

```sql
SELECT blah blah
```

Then we can explain what we do from there, followed by maybe another query

```sql
SELECT more blah blah
```

And so forth!
